### Setup and End-to-End Data Engineering with Apache Spark, Azure Databricks, and DBT
Welcome to the Setup and End-to-End Data Engineering project, where we leverage the power of Apache Spark, Azure Databricks, and Data Build Tool (DBT) on Microsoft Azure's cloud infrastructure. This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the process of data engineering, covering data ingestion, integration, transformation, and management in a lakehouse architecture.

##### Overview
In this project, we illustrate the complete data engineering workflow, starting from data ingestion to the lakehouse, integrating data with Azure Data Factory (ADF), performing data transformation using Azure Databricks, and finally, applying DBT for data modeling and management.

##### Key Components
Apache Spark: We utilize Apache Spark for scalable and distributed data processing, enabling us to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
Azure Databricks: Azure Databricks provides a unified analytics platform for big data and machine learning, allowing us to perform data processing, exploration, and visualization in a collaborative environment.
Data Build Tool (DBT): DBT is utilized for data transformation and modeling, enabling version-controlled, testable, and maintainable data pipelines.
Azure Cloud: Microsoft Azure serves as our cloud provider, offering robust infrastructure and services for hosting our data engineering solutions.

##### Project Workflow
Data Ingestion: We start by ingesting data from various sources into the lakehouse, leveraging Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Storage, etc.
Data Integration with ADF: Azure Data Factory is used for data integration, facilitating the movement and orchestration of data across various data stores and services.
Data Transformation with Databricks: Data transformation tasks are performed using Azure Databricks, where we execute Spark jobs to clean, preprocess, and enrich the data.
Data Modeling with DBT: DBT is employed for data modeling and management, allowing us to define transformations, apply business logic, and create analytical datasets.
Pipeline Orchestration and Monitoring: Azure Data Factory is utilized for pipeline orchestration and monitoring, ensuring smooth execution and tracking of data workflows.
